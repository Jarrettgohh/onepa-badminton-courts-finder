# Onepa-Badminton-Courts-Finder-Python

# PACKAGES
Libraries used in this project includes requests & beautiful soup.

# USAGE

To run on the shell

py onepa.py
```

# COMPATIBILITY NOTE
- It seems that https://onepa.gov.sg has changed their website structure for the Badminton courts
- Thus, this automation software may not work as expected

# FUTURE UPDATES
- Summary of all the available courts at the end of scipt process 
- To run script once to query over a period of dates (Eg. 1 week -- 7 Days)

# WARNING
Using of scripts to book badminton courts in onePA is not allowed. This project is just an experiment to automate finding of courts, but can't be used to book courts; there is no intention to cause any damage to the website.
