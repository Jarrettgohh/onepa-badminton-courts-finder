-------------------------
POSSIBLE REASONS COURT BOOKING SCRIPT IS NOT WORKING
------------------------

---
1. Webkitformboundary malformed

Tried the following:
#1 from requests_toolbelt import MultipartEncoder to generate the multipart/form-data
- tried to use .to_string() and str(.to_string()) to change up the data


---
2. Cookies not properly persisted between singpass auth with selenium and subsequent requests using python-requests library to www.onepa.gov.sg

Specific cookies to take note of:
#1 `_RequestVerificationToken` cookie seems to be updated in the "Set-Cookie" response headers from the retrieve cart token route

>> current workflow: 
# 1 retrieve cookies from selenium upon auth flow done
#2 set cookies in cookiejar
#3 update session cookies with self.s.cookies.set_cookie() before sending request to retrieve cart token
#4 session cookies should be persisted till the quick book facility route is called without explicitly setting the `Cookie` header
