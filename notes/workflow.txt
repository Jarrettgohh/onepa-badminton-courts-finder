********************
NOTE: If certain API doesn't work, check the following
1. The `referer` header is set
2. content-type and accept headers
3. cookie is set by requests session - by sending GET requests to the main onepa.gov.sg or relevant urls (https://www.onepa.gov.sg/facilities/search?facility=BADMINTON%20COURT)
********************


1. Retrieve a list of CC outlets: 
https://www.onepa.gov.sg/pacesapi/facilitysearch/searchjson?facility=BADMINTON%20COURTS&outlet=&date=&time=&page={page}&division=
-> where `page` would be an int from 1 to about 10
-> the `totalResults` field would contain the total number of results - to call this api at the start of the script and check this value with the value in the main .json file (previously loaded from the script call)

2. If the `totalResults` value has changed: Retrieve the lat, lng detail for the new outlet:
https://www.onepa.gov.sg/pacesapi/catalogs/outlets


3. Create and load a .json file with the detail of the location (lat, lng) facilityid, etc. for each outlet

4. Iterate through each outlet in the main .json file and call the api to retrieve court listing detail:
https://www.onepa.gov.sg/pacesapi/facilityavailability/GetFacilitySlots?selectedFacility=<facilityid>_BADMINTONCOURTS&selectedDate=

-> `facilityid` would be defined in the main .json file
